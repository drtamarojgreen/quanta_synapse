# LLM Integration Implementation Plan

This document provides a detailed implementation plan for the vision outlined in `llm_integration_vision.md`. It breaks down the vision into actionable phases and tasks.

---

## Phase 1: Core LLM Integration (`quanta_tissu`)

This phase focuses on building the foundational components for seamless interaction with the `quanta_tissu` language model.

### Task 1.1: Define and Implement New Signal Types

*   **Objective:** Standardize the data structures for LLM-related communication.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Define a formal schema (e.g., JSON Schema or XSD) for the new `Signal` types: `llm_prompt`, `llm_response`, `llm_finetune_data`, `llm_analysis_request`, and `llm_analysis_response`. The schema will be stored in a shared repository.
    2.  Create a new header file, `cpp/include/LLMSignal.h`, to define the C++ structs for these new signal types. These structs will be derived from or compose the base `Signal` struct.
    3.  Update the C++ `QuantaSynapse` library to handle the serialization and deserialization of these new signal types.
    4.  Update the Python `quanta_synapse` library to provide classes for these new signal types and handle their serialization/deserialization.
    5.  Create example usage snippets in the documentation for both C++ and Python.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Schema file for LLM signals.
    *   `LLMSignal.h` file.
    *   Updated C++ and Python libraries.
    *   Documentation with examples.

### Task 1.2: Establish Dedicated LLM Topics

*   **Objective:** Create a well-defined topic structure for routing LLM-related signals.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Formally document the new topic hierarchy: `services.llm.generation`, `services.llm.analysis`, and `services.llm.finetuning`.
    2.  Update the message bus configuration (e.g., RabbitMQ or ZeroMQ) to support these new topics and any required routing rules.
    3.  Update the `quanta_tissu` wrapper to subscribe to these topics.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Updated documentation for the topic hierarchy.
    *   Updated message bus configuration.

### Task 1.3: Implement Large Payload Handling

*   **Objective:** Ensure `QuantaSynapse` can handle large data payloads from LLM responses.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Design a chunking mechanism. This will involve defining a chunking protocol to split large messages into smaller parts and reassemble them at the destination.
    2.  Alternatively, design a reference-based messaging system. This will involve integrating with a data store like `quanta_memora` to store large payloads and pass references in the signals.
    3.  Implement the chosen mechanism in both the C++ and Python `QuantaSynapse` libraries.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Design document for the large payload handling mechanism.
    *   Updated C++ and Python libraries with the implementation.

## Phase 2: Knowledge Integration (`quanta_glia`)

This phase focuses on leveraging the `quanta_glia` knowledge management system to enrich communication.

### Task 2.1: Develop Contextual Enrichment Service

*   **Objective:** Enable `QuantaSynapse` to automatically enrich signals with relevant context from `quanta_glia`.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Define a clear API for querying `quanta_glia` for contextual information related to a signal.
    2.  Implement the service in `QuantaSynapse` as an optional middleware component. This component will intercept signals, query `quanta_glia`, and attach the retrieved context to the signal's content.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   API documentation for the `quanta_glia` query service.
    *   Contextual enrichment middleware in `QuantaSynapse`.

### Task 2.2: Create System State Awareness API

*   **Objective:** Provide a way for components to get a high-level overview of the ecosystem's state from `quanta_glia`.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Define the API for the system state awareness service. This API will provide access to key metrics and trends from `quanta_glia`.
    2.  Implement this service in `quanta_glia` and expose it via a dedicated topic in `QuantaSynapse`.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   API documentation for the system state awareness service.
    *   Implementation of the service in `quanta_glia`.

## Phase 3: Intelligent `QuantaSynapse`

This phase focuses on embedding LLM capabilities directly into `QuantaSynapse`.

### Task 3.1: Implement Intelligent Routing

*   **Objective:** Use an LLM to enable content-based routing of signals.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Prototype a routing service that takes a signal, uses `quanta_tissu` to determine the most appropriate destination component, and forwards the signal.
    2.  Integrate this service into `QuantaSynapse` as a new routing strategy.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Prototype of the intelligent routing service.
    *   Integration of the service into `QuantaSynapse`.

### Task 3.2: Implement Content Summarization

*   **Objective:** Provide automated summaries for high-volume topics.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Develop a summarization service that subscribes to specified high-volume topics.
    2.  This service will use `quanta_tissu` to generate periodic summaries and publish them to a new `.summary` sub-topic.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Summarization service.

### Task 3.3: Implement Ethical Scoring Assistance

*   **Objective:** Use an LLM to assist in the ethical scoring of signals.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Create a service that analyzes the content of a signal and suggests an initial `ethicsScore`.
    2.  Integrate this service with `quanta_ethos`, which will have the final say on the score. The suggested score will be passed to `quanta_ethos` for validation.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Ethical scoring assistance service.
    *   Integration with `quanta_ethos`.
