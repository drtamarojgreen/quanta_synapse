# QuantaSynapse Integration Plan

This document outlines the strategy for integrating the various Quanta projects using the QuantaSynapse connector.

## Core Integration Strategy

QuantaSynapse will provide a central communication bus for all Quanta projects, enabling them to work together as a single, cohesive system. This will be achieved through a combination of a standardized data format, lightweight API wrappers, and a robust message queue.

### Standardized Data Format

A common data format is essential for ensuring seamless communication between projects. We will use a flexible, human-readable, and widely supported format.

*   **Format:** XML will be the primary data exchange format. Its schema (XSD) will be well-defined and versioned to ensure backward compatibility.
*   **Schema:** A set of standardized XML schemas (XSDs) will be defined for common message types (e.g., events, commands, queries, responses). These schemas will be published in a central repository for all projects to use.
*   **Validation:** All messages will be validated against the schema before being published to the message bus, ensuring data integrity.

### API Wrappers

Each project will be integrated into the QuantaSynapse ecosystem via a lightweight API wrapper. These wrappers will expose the project's functionality to the communication bus.

*   **Responsibilities:** The wrapper will be responsible for connecting to the message queue, serializing and deserializing messages, and translating between the project's internal data model and the standardized XML format.
*   **Implementation:** Wrappers will be implemented in the native language of each project (e.g., C++, Python) and will use the QuantaSynapse connector library.
*   **Discovery:** Wrappers will register the services they provide with a central discovery service, allowing other projects to find and interact with them dynamically.

### Message Queue

A message queue will be used for asynchronous communication between projects, providing loose coupling and scalability.

*   **Technology:** We will evaluate and select a suitable message queue technology, such as RabbitMQ or ZeroMQ. The choice will be based on performance, reliability, and ease of use.
*   **Topology:** A topic-based routing topology will be used. Each message will be published to a specific topic (e.g., `events.prismquanta.new_rule`), and projects can subscribe to the topics they are interested in.
*   **Guarantees:** The message queue will be configured to provide at-least-once delivery guarantees, ensuring that no messages are lost in transit.

## Project-Specific Integration Details

*   **prismquanta & quanta_porto:** These projects form the philosophical and technical core of the Quanta ecosystem. QuantaSynapse will expose their PQL and rule systems to other projects, allowing them to be controlled and monitored in a structured way.
*   **quanta_alarma, quanta_pulsa, & quanta_quilida:** These are monitoring and advisory systems. They will subscribe to events from other projects via QuantaSynapse and publish alerts and recommendations back to the bus.
*   **quanta_cerebra, quanta_retina, & quanta_dorsa:** These are visualization and simulation tools. They will subscribe to data streams from other projects and publish their visualizations and simulation results back to the bus.
*   **quanta_cogno:** This is a genomics API. QuantaSynapse will provide a bridge for other projects to query this API and incorporate its data into their workflows.
*   **quanta_ethos:** This is the ethical framework for the Quanta ecosystem. QuantaSynapse will enforce the policies defined in this framework by intercepting and validating all inter-project communication.
*   **quanta_glia:** This is a knowledge management system. It will subscribe to events from other projects and use them to build and maintain a knowledge base for the entire ecosystem.
*   **quanta_lista & quanta_serene:** These are task management and scheduling systems. They will use QuantaSynapse to coordinate the activities of other projects and ensure that tasks are executed in the correct order.
*   **quanta_memora & quanta_occipita:** These are project generation and bootstrapping tools. They will use QuantaSynapse to create new projects and integrate them into the ecosystem.
*   **quanta_sensa:** This is an autonomous workflow agent. It will use QuantaSynapse to interact with other projects and execute complex workflows.
*   **quanta_tissu:** This is a transformer-based language model. QuantaSynapse will provide a bridge for other projects to use this model for natural language processing tasks.
